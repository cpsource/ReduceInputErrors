### **Reducing Errors with a Double-Counted Input Dial**  

How can we reduce input errors when entering data using a dial-based interface?  

Consider an iPhone timer, where setting a time of **one minute and zero seconds** requires selecting "0" on a dial that cycles from **0 to 59**. If a user accidentally lands on "59" instead of "0," they introduce a **59-second error**—a significant mistake with a one-in-sixty chance of occurring.  

Now, imagine redesigning the dial so that it counts up and then back down, displaying values as **0, 1, 2, … 59, 58, 57, 56… 1, 0**. With this format, the probability of an input error remains the same (one-in-sixty), but the consequences are drastically reduced. Instead of potentially being off by **59 seconds**, the worst-case error is now just **one second**.  

This approach is an example of **human-centered design** at its best. Rather than trying to eliminate mistakes altogether—an impossible task when humans are involved—we acknowledge the inevitability of error and focus on **minimizing its impact** through intelligent design. By implementing a **double-counted dial**, we reduce the consequences of small slip-ups, making interactions more forgiving and user-friendly.
